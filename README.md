# Movie-Management-API
This project is a small, but fullyâ€‘featured REST API for storing and managing a collection of movies. It was  written as part of a coding exercise and deliberately keeps the scope clear and simple: you can add, list, edit  and delete movies, all while enjoying validation, pagination, Swagger documentation and unit tests.
